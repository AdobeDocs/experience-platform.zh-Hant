# 在使用者介面中建立[!DNL Pinterest Ads]來源連線

>[!NOTE]
>
>[!DNL Pinterest Ads]來源是測試版。 閱讀[來源概觀](../../../../home.md#terms-and-conditions)，以取得使用測試版標籤之來源的詳細資訊。

本教學課程提供使用Adobe Experience Platform使用者介面建立[!DNL Pinterest Ads]來源聯結器的步驟。

## 快速入門 {#getting-started}

本教學課程需要您實際瞭解下列Experience Platform元件：

* [[!DNL Experience Data Model (XDM)] 系統](../../../../../xdm/home.md)： Experience Platform用來組織客戶體驗資料的標準化架構。
   * [結構描述組合的基本概念](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md)：瞭解XDM結構描述的基本建置區塊，包括結構描述組合中的關鍵原則和最佳實務。
   * [結構描述編輯器教學課程](../../../../../xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.md)：瞭解如何使用結構描述編輯器使用者介面建立自訂結構描述。
* [[!DNL Real-Time Customer Profile]](../../../../../profile/home.md)：根據來自多個來源的彙總資料，提供統一的即時消費者設定檔。

## 先決條件 {#prerequisites}

為了將[!DNL Pinterest Ads]連線到Experience Platform，您必須提供下列連線屬性的值：

* [!DNL Pinterest]存取權杖。
* [!DNL Pinterest]廣告帳戶識別碼。
* [!DNL Pinterest]行銷活動、廣告群組或廣告ID的其中之一（視需要）。

如需這些連線屬性的詳細資訊，請閱讀[[!DNL Pinterest Ads] 總覽](../../../../connectors/advertising/pinterest-ads.md#prerequisites)。

### 建立Platform結構描述 {#create-platform-schema}

您也必須確保先建立要用於[!DNL Pinterst Ads]來源的Platform結構描述。 閱讀有關[建立Platform結構描述](../../../../../xdm/schema/composition.md)的教學課程，以瞭解如何建立結構描述的完整步驟。

![Pinterest Ads的平台結構描述範例](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/schema.png)

如需[!DNL Pinterest]行銷活動、廣告群組和廣告API支援的欄位清單，請參閱[[!DNL Pinterest] 欄位](#pinterest-fields)區段。

## 連線您的[!DNL Pinterest Ads]帳戶 {#connect-account}

在Platform UI中，從左側導覽列選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL 來源]**&#x200B;以存取[!UICONTROL 來源]工作區。 [!UICONTROL 目錄]畫面會顯示您可以用來建立帳戶的各種來源。

您可以從熒幕左側的目錄中選取適當的類別。 或者，您可以使用搜尋選項來尋找您要使用的特定來源。

在&#x200B;*Advertising*&#x200B;類別下，選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL Pinterest Ads]**，然後選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL 新增資料]**。

![Experience Platform上的來源目錄。](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/catalog.png)

**[!UICONTROL 連線Pinterest Ads帳戶]**&#x200B;頁面隨即顯示。 您可以在此頁面使用新的證明資料或現有的證明資料。

### 現有帳戶 {#existing-account}

若要使用現有帳戶，請選取您要用來建立新資料流的[!DNL Pinterest Ads]帳戶，然後選取[下一步] ]**以繼續。**[!UICONTROL 

![來源工作流程的現有帳戶步驟。](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/existing.png)

### 新帳戶 {#new-account}

如果您正在建立新帳戶，請選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL 新帳戶]**，然後提供名稱、選擇性說明和您的認證。 完成時，請選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL 連線到來源]**，然後等待一段時間以建立新連線。

![來源工作流程的新帳戶步驟。](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/new.png)



## 選取資料 {#select-data}

**[!UICONTROL 選取資料]**&#x200B;步驟隨即顯示，提供介面供您輸入資訊，這些資訊會傳遞至API，以將您想要的資料帶入Platform。

| 欄位 | 說明 |
| --- | --- |
| [!UICONTROL ad_account_id] | 您的[!DNL Pinterest Ads]廣告帳戶識別碼。 如果您需要任何指引，請參閱[[!DNL Pinterest] 在廣告管理員](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/find-ids-in-ads-manager)中尋找ID指南。 |
| [!UICONTROL 物件型別] | 根據您要從哪個[!DNL Pinterest]個Analytics API取得資訊，選取&#x200B;**行銷活動**、**廣告群組**&#x200B;或&#x200B;**廣告**&#x200B;其中之一。 |
| [!UICONTROL object_ids] | 所選物件的ID。 導覽至&#x200B;**Pinterest商業中心** > **廣告帳戶摘要** > **行銷活動** / **廣告群組** / **廣告**&#x200B;的[!DNL Pinterest]頁面，並複製每個名稱下方提及的必要ID。 |

>[!TIP]
>
>您可以傳遞逗號分隔值以提供多個`object_ids`。 您可以在單一請求中傳遞的ID數量上限為100。 如果傳遞的值不正確，Platform會顯示下列訊息： `The request could not be processed. Error from flow provider: Unknown error while processing request.`

提供值之後，請選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL 選取]**。 如果提供的值有效，將會填入介面的正確部分（預覽資料）。

![來源工作流程的選取資料步驟。](../../../../images/tutorials/create/advertising/pinterest-ads/select-data.png)

## 後續步驟 {#next-steps}

依照本教學課程中的指示，您已建立與[!DNL Pinterest Ads]帳戶的連線。 您現在可以繼續進行下一個教學課程，並[設定資料流以將廣告資料帶入Platform](../../dataflow/advertising.md)。

## 其他資源 {#additional-resources}

以下各節提供在使用[!DNL Pinterest Ads]來源時可以參考的其他資源。

## 正在排程 {#scheduling}

排程[!DNL Pinterest Ads]資料流進行內嵌時，您必須選取下列其中一個頻率和間隔設定：

| 頻率 | 間隔 |
| --- | --- |
| `Day` | 1 |
| `Hour` | 24 |

如需排程[!DNL Pinterest Ads]資料流的詳細資訊，請閱讀 [!DNL Pinterest Ads] 總覽](../../../../connectors/advertising/pinterest-ads.md#guardrails)的[護欄區段。

提供排程的值之後，請選取&#x200B;**[!UICONTROL 下一步]**。
